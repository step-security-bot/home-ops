### Troubleshooting Guide

#### etcdserver: member not found (durring upgrade)

```console
talosctl upgrade --nodes 192.168.1.53 \
      --image ghcr.io/siderolabs/installer:v1.7.2 --wait --debug
```

```console
â—² watching nodes: [192.168.1.53]
    * 192.168.1.53: 1 error(s) occurred:
    sequence error: sequence failed: error running phase 4 in upgrade sequence: task 1/1: failed, failed to leave cluster: 2 error(s) occurred:
    failed to remove member 12511542852590030096: etcdserver: server stopped
    failed to remove member 12511542852590030096: etcdserver: member not found
```

1. reset the node after reboot

```console
talosctl -n 192.168.1.53 reset --graceful=false --reboot --system-labels-to-wipe=EPHEMERAL
```

when upgrading from 1.7.1 to 1.7.2 network connectivity was not established after reset, a hard power cycle was required

2. assure everything is working again

```console
talosctl etcd members
```

```console
WARNING: 1 error occurred:
        * 192.168.1.54: rpc error: code = Unimplemented desc = member list is only available on control plane nodes
